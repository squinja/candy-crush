# Poke Pop game

The live hosted site is available at: https://candy-crush-eschaale.netlify.app/.

This project was inspired by + uses code from Ania Kubow's video series on how to build a front-end and back-end in React (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBrEq9Wd6_U).

Front-end features I added include:

- Retro pixel art for icons & logo I designed in Aseprite using Candy Crush's assets
- High score board

Back-end Functionality I added:

- User login
  - Check to see if your username already exists, and if so, 'log in' (no passwords -yet)
- User Deletion when logged in
- High score board to compare with other users
- Ability to save your score to high score board & auto-save when you win
