# Candy Crush game

The live hosted site is coming soon.

This project was inspired by Ania Kubow's video series on how to build a front-end and back-end in React (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBrEq9Wd6_U). 

Front-end features I added include:
- Retro pixel art for icons & logo I designed in Aseprite using Candy Crush's assets
- High score board

##Back-end Functionality I added:
- User login
- High score board to compare with other users
- Ability to save your score to high score board
